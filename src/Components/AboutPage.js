            ABOUT PROGRAM DIRECTOR-WUMI
            <span className="standOutText"> AGUNBIADE </span>
          </Typography>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
            With over 15 years of direct & indirect experience in the game of
            basketball, both as a player & coach at professional levels, Wumi
            Agunbiade is a notable & respected name in the North American
            basketball arena. Starting at the tender age of 6 years old Wumi
            realized her passion for the sport she lived & breathed, yet often
            found barriers as she attempted to navigate requirements to get to
            her dreams. Luckily for Wumi, through mentorship along the way,
            relentless parents, & her personal commitment to “putting in the
            work” -She is a decorated athlete of her time. She played three
            years professionally, was awarded new-comer of the year, and played
            in the highest leagues. As a NCAA Division 1 student-athlete she was
            recognized as the Rookie of the Year, second all-time leading
            scorer, and four-time all-conference selection while on honor roll.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is through Wumi’s personal experience, that she celebrates the
            many gains young athletes can realize through the game of
            basketball, with emphasis on education; having earned a
            post-secondary, & graduate degree (MBA) from the University of
            Pittsburgh, fueled & funded by the game of basketball; alongside
            invaluable life altering experiences with Global access across the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing what she personally gained from the game she truly
            loves, Wumi’s objective in the creation of Make it WHOop, centers
            around a desire to equip, enable & empower young athletes as they
            pursue their dreams. In Wumi’s definition, Make it WHOop provides
            “access, information & support” - core ingredients to support the
            young athlete, parents in their navigation of the basketball
            recruitment process. Further, Make it WHOop ensures a dual
            accountability model to success. There is a part for everyone to
            play in getting to the collective end goal. In Wumi’s vision, with
            collaboration, ownership & the right tools, it’s achievable.
          </p>
          <p>Wumi says it best in this quote: </p>
          <p>
            “My mission is to help young Canadian women define WHO they are
            using the game of basketball as a vehicle. I know what this game has
            done for me and my family and I know what it can do for that one
            little girl who sees the game as her greatest past-time. My goal is
            to see our youth achieve their dreams in ways I never knew existed
            when I was their age.”{" "}
